      An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the ground caused by the shifting of rocks deep underneath
      the earth’s surface. Earthquakes can cause fires, tsunamis, landslides or avalanches. While they can happen
      anywhere without warning.

      Make an Emergency Plan: Create a family emergency communications plan that has an out-of-state contact. 
      Plan where to meet if you get separated. Make a supply kit that includes enough food and water for 
      several days, a flashlight, a fire extinguisher and a whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      - Being prepared allows you to avoid unnecessary excursions and to address minor medical issues at home, 
      alleviating the burden on urgent care centers and hospitals.
    </p> 
    <p>
      - Remember that not everyone can afford to respond by stocking up on necessities. For those who can afford 
      it, make essential purchases and slowly build up supplies.
    </p>
      <br>
    <p>
      Protect Your Home: Secure heavy items in your home like bookcases, refrigerators, water heaters, televisions
      and objects that hang on walls. Store heavy and breakable objects on low shelves.
    </p>
    <p>
      - Consider making improvements to your building to fix structural issues that could cause your building to 
      collapse during an earthquake.

      <p>
        If an earthquake happens, you and your loved ones may need to evacuate a damaged area afterward. By planning
        and practicing for evacuation, you will be better prepared to respond appropriately and efficiently to signs
        of danger or to directions by civil authorities.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        - Take a few minutes with your family to discuss a home evacuation plan. Sketch a floor plan of your home, walk 
        through each room, and discuss evacuation details. If you live downstream from a dam, know flood-zone information.
      </p>
        <p>
          - Plan a second way to exit from each room or area, if possible. If you need special equipment, such as a rope ladder,
          mark where it is located.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Mark where your emergency supply kit (including food, water, first aid) and fire extinguishers are located.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Locate where the utility switches or valves are located so that they can be turned off, if possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Indicate the location of your family’s emergency outdoor meeting place.

      1. DROP down onto your hands and knees immediately. This position protects you from falling but still allows
       you to move if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.COVER your head and neck (and your entire body if possible) underneath a sturdy table or desk. If there is 
      no shelter nearby, get down near an interior wall or next to low-lying furniture that won’t fall on you, and 
      cover your head and neck with your arms and hands. Try to stay clear of windows or glass that could shatter or
      objects that could fall on you.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.HOLD ON to your shelter (or to your head and neck) until the shaking stops. Be prepared to move with your 
      shelter if the shaking shifts it around.

      DO NOT run outside or to other rooms during an earthquake. You are less likely to be injured if you stay where you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      To reduce your chances of being hurt, take the following actions:
    </p>
    <p>
      - If possible, within the few seconds before shaking intensifies, quickly move away from glass, hanging objects, bookcases,
       china cabinets, or other large furniture that could fall. Watch for falling objects, such as bricks from fireplaces and 
       chimneys, light fixtures, wall hangings, high shelves, and cabinets with doors that could swing open.
    </p>
    <p>
      If available nearby, grab something to shield your head and face from falling debris and broken glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are in the kitchen, quickly turn off the stove and take cover at the first sign of shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are in bed, hold on and stay there, protecting your head with a pillow. You are less likely to 
      be injured staying where you are. Broken glass on the floor can cause injuries if you walk or roll 
      onto the floor.

    <p>
      Damaged buildings, damaged power lines, and leaking gas and water lines are just a few of 
      the hazards you might face after an earthquake. Keep yourself and your loved ones safe 
      after an earthquake by following the recommendations below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Expect Aftershocks</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      - After an earthquake, you may experience aftershocks. Aftershocks are smaller earthquakes 
      that follow a larger earthquake. These can happen minutes, days, weeks, or even months after 
      an earthquake.
    </p>
    <p>
      - If you feel an aftershock, DROP, COVER, and HOLD ON.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>If you are in an area at risk for tsunamis, go inland and seek higher ground.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      - In some cases, earthquakes can cause tsunamis in areas along the coast. 
      These can happen minutes to hours after a strong earthquake.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you hear an official tsunami warning or notice signs of a tsunami, 
      evacuate immediately. Get to higher ground as far inland as possible. 
      Follow instructions from local authorities — they may direct you to 
      a different route than you had planned.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Be careful near damaged buildings.</b>
    </p>
    <p>- Do not enter a damaged building. Earthquakes can damage buildings 
      and make them unsafe. Wait until local authorities tell you it is 
      safe to go inside.
