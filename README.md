## Introduction
<p align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natural calamities are typical natural phenomena that occur in every country throughout the world, and in the Philippines, it is one of the countries that is considered to be calamity prone.  However, one of the major issues for disaster risk reduction offices is residents' lack of understanding about what to do before, during, and after a natural catastrophe occurs. Localities remain dependent on old DRRM approaches.  We live in a digital age, which necessitates a modern approach to DRRM.

<p align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, one of the significant challenges faced by the disaster risk reduction offices is the lack of knowledge among the citizens on what to do before, during, and after a natural hazard occurs. One of the municipalities facing such difficulty is the Alitagtag DRRM Department, which has 19 barangays. The Municipal DRRM Office conducts pre-disaster risk assessment, rapid assessments and post disaster assessments in its community. At present they communicate with residents mostly through barangay generated announcements. Meanwhile, residents who have an emergency call the MDRRMO emergency hotline for assistance. As for further awareness drives, they use their Facebook page and disaster-related content that can be posted in this media is limited. In addition, the majority of this content comes from national offices and is thus not localized. This problem is easily resolved by applying modern technology.
